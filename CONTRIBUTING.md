## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

- Check if the bug has already been reported in [Issues](https://github.com/harekrishnarai/gha-pinner/issues)
- If not, create a new issue using the bug report template
- Include as much detail as possible: steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, environment details

### Suggesting Features

- Check if the feature has already been requested in [Issues](https://github.com/harekrishnarai/gha-pinner/issues)
- If not, create a new issue using the feature request template
- Clearly describe the feature and its benefits
- Consider discussing in [Discussions](https://github.com/harekrishnarai/gha-pinner/discussions) first for major features

### Contributing Code

1. **Find an issue to work on** or create one
2. **Comment on the issue** to let others know you're working on it
3. **Create a branch** for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
4. **Make your changes** following the coding standards
5. **Write tests** for your changes
6. **Update documentation** if needed
7. **Test your changes** thoroughly
8. **Commit your changes** with clear commit messages
9. **Push your branch** and create a pull request

## Coding Standards

### Go Style Guidelines

- Follow the [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)
- Use `go fmt` to format your code
- Use `go vet` to check for common errors
- Use `golangci-lint` for comprehensive linting

### Code Organization

- Keep functions small and focused
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Organize code into logical packages
- Follow the existing project structure

### Error Handling

- Always handle errors appropriately
- Use descriptive error messages
- Wrap errors with context when appropriate
- Don't ignore errors silently

### Example Code Style

```go
// Good
func processRepository(repoPath string) error {
    if repoPath == "" {
        return fmt.Errorf("repository path cannot be empty")
    }
    
    // Process repository logic here
    return nil
}

// Bad
func process(p string) error {
    // No validation, unclear naming
    return nil
}
```

## Testing

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Follow the table-driven test pattern when appropriate
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Test Organization

- Place tests in the same package as the code being tested
- Use `_test.go` suffix for test files
- Group related tests together
- Use setup and teardown functions when needed

### Example Test

```go
func TestProcessRepository(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name     string
        repoPath string
        wantErr  bool
    }{
        {
            name:     "valid repository path",
            repoPath: "/valid/path",
            wantErr:  false,
        },
        {
            name:     "empty repository path",
            repoPath: "",
            wantErr:  true,
        },
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            err := processRepository(tt.repoPath)
            if (err != nil) != tt.wantErr {
                t.Errorf("processRepository() error = %v, wantErr %v", err, tt.wantErr)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...

# View coverage report
go tool cover -html=coverage.out

# Run tests with race detection
go test -race ./...

# Run specific test
go test -run TestProcessRepository ./...
```

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Document all public functions, types, and constants
- Use Go doc conventions
- Include examples in documentation when helpful
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes

### README Updates

- Update the README.md if your changes affect:
  - Installation instructions
  - Usage examples
  - Feature descriptions
  - Configuration options

### Example Documentation

```go
// ProcessRepository processes a Git repository and pins GitHub Actions
// to specific commit hashes for improved security.
//
// The repoPath parameter must be a valid path to a Git repository.
// Returns an error if the repository cannot be processed.
//
// Example:
//   err := ProcessRepository("/path/to/repo")
//   if err != nil {
//       log.Fatal(err)
//   }
func ProcessRepository(repoPath string) error {
    // Implementation here
}
```
